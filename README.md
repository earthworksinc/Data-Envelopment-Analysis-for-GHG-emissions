# Data-Envelopment-Analysis for GHG-emissions vs Energy-consumption per capita

Data envelopment analysis is a method to develop frontiers for multiple systems designed to produce similar products or services. The DEA models: CRS (Constant Return to Scale) and VRS (Variable Return to Scale) are designed to accomodate the economies of scale for the systems analyzed. 

Data source for the analyzed results is https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics?country=CANADA&fuel=Key%20indicators&indicator=ElecConsPerCapita.
